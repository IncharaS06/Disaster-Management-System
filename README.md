# 🌍 Disaster Management System

An intelligent AI-powered **Disaster Management System** developed to predict, visualize, and respond to natural disasters such as **cyclones**, **earthquakes**, and **floods**. This project utilizes machine learning models trained with real datasets to provide early warnings, live updates, and coordinated aid response—achieving over **85% accuracy** across disaster types.

## 🚨 Purpose

To create a reliable system that assists governments, NGOs, and civilians in preparing for and responding to disasters in real time—ensuring faster evacuations, better resource allocation, and reduced casualties.

## 🧠 Features

- 🔍 **Disaster Prediction Models** for cyclone, earthquake & flood  
- 📈 Model Accuracy > 85%, powered by Kaggle datasets  
- 🌧️ **Live Weather Updates** using OpenWeatherMap API  
- 🗺️ **Danger Zone Mapping** for real-time geospatial awareness  
- 🏕️ **Refugee Reallocation** based on proximity & safety zones  
- 📢 Alert broadcasts and summary dashboards  
- 🧭 Intuitive interface for authorities and volunteers
